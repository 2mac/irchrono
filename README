irchrono
========

An Arduino chronograph using infrared light sensors.

Notes
-----

This sketch uses the `micros()` function which will overflow in less than an
hour. It is assumed that one would not go for more than a few seconds between
triggering the sensors, so this would not affect normal operation. If your use
case involves several minutes between the sensors, you should use the
`millis()` function instead which will take days to overflow.
